<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Let's take a look inside the question-answering system! In this stage, we will see what happens after the bot takes a user request and how it processes it.</p><p>Text preprocessing is a necessary part of every NLP project, including the creation of a question answering bot. In NLP tasks, words are often converted to vectors, so a program can handle them and make some operations. But the <code class="java">Hello, world!</code> and <code class="java">hello world</code> sentences have different vectors because letter case and punctuation marks influence the vectors. To get rid of the difference, you need to preprocess the text. </p><p>Write a program that will be used for preprocessing a training corpus and userâ€™s queries. This program should take a string, convert it to lowercase, tokenize it, and remove the punctuation. As different tokenization functions provide different output, use the <code class="java">word_tokenize()</code> function from the NLTK package to pass all tests correctly.</p><p>You'll need the training corpus in the following stages. In this project, we will use a sample of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/200000-jeopardy-questions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">200,000+ Jeopardy! Questions</a> dataset. You can load it from the <em>jeopardy.json</em> file. Download the sample from here: <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/832889/jeopardy.json" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">jeopardy.json</a>.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>In this stage, your program should:</p><ol><li><p>Read a file that contains a training corpus;</p></li><li><p>Print the greeting and take the user's input as before;</p></li><li><p>Preprocess both the training corpus and a user request as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Convert the text to lowercase with the <code class="java">lower()</code> function;</p></li><li><p>Tokenize the text by words;</p></li><li><p>Remove the punctuation marks from the token list.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Store the training corpus in a list of lists where each list is a tokenized sentence; it will be useful for the next stage;</p></li><li><p>Print the <code class="java">Let's play!</code> message and the result of tokenization for the user request.</p></li></ol><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input.
