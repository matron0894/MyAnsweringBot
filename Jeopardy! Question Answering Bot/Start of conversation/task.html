<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>User greeting is the face of our question answering system. When users start a conversation with a QA bot, they want to know what the system can do. To personalize such bots, developers give them names (for example, Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and so on).</p>
<p>In this stage, teach your bot to greet a user and ask for their request. Your QA bot should say their name (you can choose any name you like). After greeting, the bot should ask for a user request and take it. </p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print a greeting message: <code class="java">Hello! I'm (the QA bot name you chose), a question answering bot who knows answers to all questions from the 'Jeopardy!' game.</code></li>
<li>Ask a user to input their request with the <code class="java">Ask me something!</code> string and read the query;</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">Let's play!</code> after reading user input to make it clear the bot has taken the request.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: <em>the QA bot introduces themselves and the user inputs their query</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! I'm Jane, a question answering bot who knows answers to all the questions from the 'Jeopardy!' game.
Ask me something!
&gt; Get me a "Noah's boy on bread", one of these lunch favorites.
Let's play!</code></pre>
