<h2>Number of users</h2>
<p></p>
<p>There is a JSON file <em>users.json. </em>The file has already been created and filled with data.</p>
<p>It has the following structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "age": 33
    },
    ...
  ]
}</code></pre>
<p>Find out how many users are defined in this file and print this number.</p>
<p>Note that the <code class="language-json">json</code> module has already been imported, you don't need to import it again!</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Convert the JSON file to a dictionary and get the size of the list of users.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
